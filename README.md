# MineChopFish

## What it does

This is a small application that will type:

yui mine [enter]

yui chop [enter]

yui fish [enter]

at a interval of around 3 seconds total between the initial yui mine and the next one.

## Shortcuts

**Ctrl+0** will start and stop the typing. 

**Ctrl+Shift+0** will kill the program entirely.

**Note:** You can also start and stop it by clicking the tray icon, and toggling "Running".


## An example usage of the program is, from within the directory where everything is installed, type this in your terminal:

`$ npm install` [only need to do this once]

`$ npm run start`

**Ctrl+0** to toggle start and pause, **Ctrl+Shift+0** to completely kill the program, requiring a `$ npm run start` to run it again.

## How to start it for beginners

So to start, you will need to have NodeJS installed, which is downloadable here:
https://nodejs.org/en/

Once this is done, clone the repository into a folder of your choice by typing: 

`$ git clone https://github.com/volovikariel/MineChopFish.git` 

Having navigated to this directory with your terminal, write this:

`$ npm install` [will install the dependencies]

followed by:

`$ npm run start` [will start the main process which you can kill with **Ctrl+Shift+0**].

You should be good!
